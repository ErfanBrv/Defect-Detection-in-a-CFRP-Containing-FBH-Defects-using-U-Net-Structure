# Defect-Detection-in-a-CFRP-Containing-FBH-Defects-using-U-Net-Structure
In this project, first RMS maps corresponding to different center frequency of the Insert dataset are obtained
Then with constructing a hyper image constructed from abovementioned maps, the data for training is obtained.
For training, multiple patches of this hyper image are extracted. Then, a UNET structure is trained with such 
hyper windows. At the end, the trained model is tested on a FBH dataset.
